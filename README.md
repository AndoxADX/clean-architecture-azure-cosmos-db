# Clean Architecture with partitioned repository pattern using Azure Cosmos DB
A starting point to work with Azure Cosmos DB using ASP.NET Core, based on Clean Architecture and repository design pattern. Partition key is also implemented through the repository pattern in order to support large scale Cosmos DB.

Clean Architecture is promoted by Microsoft on their .NET application architecture guide page. The e-book written by Steve "ardalis" Smith is beautifully written and well explains the beauty and benefits of using Clean Architecture. For more details, please see [**Architect Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Azure**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/)

# Goals
The primary goal of the project is to provide a basic solution structure for anyone who is building a new ASP.NET Core web or API project using Cosmos DB.

**Please watch for this repository to get notification when I publish the repo.**
